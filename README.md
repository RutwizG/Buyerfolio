🏡 Buyer Folio Inc. – Real Estate Agent Matching Platform (Data Engineering Project)
📌 Project Overview
This project showcases an end-to-end data engineering pipeline and platform for Buyer Folio Inc., aimed at building a real estate agent-client matching system. The solution emphasizes data ingestion, processing, pipeline orchestration, model integration, and dashboarding, all aligned with real-world scalability.

The core goal is to build a robust data platform that powers intelligent agent-client matchmaking using clean, structured datasets and optimized ML pipelines—supporting real-time decision-making, visualizations, and business insights.

🚀 Features
🗃️ Data Repository
Structured, scalable database to store:

Agent profiles

Service areas

Client feedback & reviews

Transaction & engagement data

ETL pipelines built to ingest and normalize real estate data from multiple sources

🔁 ETL Pipeline
Raw JSON/CSV data processed using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and stored in SQL/NoSQL data stores

Automated transformations triggered via Airflow (or crontabs), generating clean, analytics-ready datasets

🧠 Machine Learning Integration
Preprocessed data fed into ML pipelines (XGBoost, Random Forest) to predict best-fit agents for clients

Models trained on historical transactions and client preferences

⚙️ Matching Algorithm
Multi-criteria scoring algorithm combines:

Agent specialties

Ratings

Geographic expertise

Buyer preferences

Stored output integrated with the front-end application layer via API

📊 Interactive KPI Dashboard
Built using Looker and Power BI

Tracks:

Agent performance

Match success rate

Client engagement

System usage metrics in real-time

🧪 Testing & QA
Unit and pipeline tests written in PyTest

Logs stored in structured folders under /tests

🧠 How It Works
Data Ingestion: Pulls agent, transaction, and review data from various sources using APIs and flat files

Transformation: Applies business rules and prepares data for analysis using Pandas

Storage: Saves data to AWS S3 or Azure Blob; registers schema in AWS Glue

Querying: Enables SQL analytics via Athena on top of S3

Machine Learning: Predicts agent success rates and matches clients using historical trends

Dashboard: Displays KPIs to stakeholders in Looker/Power BI

📈 KPIs Tracked
Agent match accuracy

Customer satisfaction score

Agent engagement rate

Number of successful transactions

Daily active users
