# **Buyer Folio Inc. - Real Estate Agent Matching Platform**

## **Project Overview**

This project is focused on developing a data-driven real estate agent-client matching platform for **Buyer Folio Inc.** The goal is to use machine learning and robust algorithms to match homebuyers with the most suitable agents based on agent profiles, specialties, service areas, and client preferences. The platform will enhance the user experience by providing personalized recommendations, optimizing agent-client connections, and improving decision-making.

## **Features**

1. **Data Repository**:
   - A structured, scalable database containing agent profiles, client reviews, transaction data, and other critical real estate information.

2. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Trained and validated models designed to analyze agent performance and provide personalized matches with potential clients.
   
3. **Matching Algorithm**:
   - A multi-criteria algorithm based on key agent features such as specialties, geographic coverage, and ratings to provide highly accurate client-agent recommendations.

4. **User Interface**:
   - A user-friendly interface where clients can interact with agent recommendations, explore agent profiles, and access personalized matches.
   
5. **Integrated Buyer Folio Features**:
   - Built-in tools for buyers, including buyer portfolios, communication tools, and tracking mechanisms for monitoring interactions and client satisfaction.

6. **Interactive KPI Dashboard**:
   - A **Looker**-powered dashboard visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) to track system performance and provide real-time insights.

7. **Testing & Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive reports on testing methodologies, issues, and resolutions, as well as final documentation summarizing the project and providing future direction.

8. **Final Deliverables**:
   - The complete system, including predictive models, algorithms, and a fully functional user interface, will be delivered along with a final report and presentation.

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-matching-platform.git
   ```
   
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash

## **Data Structure**

- **Agent Data**:
   - Profiles, specialties, service areas, job titles, and client reviews are stored in a structured format to facilitate matching.
   
- **Transaction Data**:
   - Historical transaction data, including sales records, buyer-agent interactions, and client satisfaction scores.
   
- **Ratings and Feedback**:
   - Agent ratings and feedback will be analyzed and incorporated into the matching algorithm to ensure clients are connected with high-quality agents.

## **How It Works**

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**:
   - We gather real estate agent profiles and transaction data from the data repository. Preprocessing includes handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature engineering.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - EDA techniques help identify key patterns in agent performance, specialties, and client preferences. Insights are derived using visualizations to improve model training.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Machine learning models such as **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** are trained on the cleaned data to predict agent performance and match clients with the most suitable agents.

4. **Matching Algorithm**:
   - The matching algorithm combines multiple features—geographic area, specialties, ratings, and buyer preferences—to suggest the best agents for clients.

5. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Stakeholders can use the Looker-powered dashboard to view real-time analytics on agent performance, client satisfaction, and system efficiency.
