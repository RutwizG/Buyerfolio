Buyer Folio Inc. – Real Estate Agent Matching Platform (Software Engineering Project)
📌 Project Overview
Buyer Folio Inc. set out to transform the real estate landscape by developing a scalable web-based platform that automatically matches buyers with real estate agents. The system’s core objective was to provide personalized, data-informed agent recommendations based on buyer preferences, location expertise, response times, and historical success metrics — all while ensuring real-time responsiveness, modular backend architecture, and clean API contracts.

The project involved full-stack backend system design, RESTful service development, API-driven integrations, and robust analytics layers to power an intuitive and responsive user experience.

❗ Business Problem
Legacy real estate systems rely on static filters or manual agent assignments, which often lead to:

Inefficient match quality between buyers and agents

Delayed response times and missed leads

Low transparency in performance metrics

Lack of scalable backend workflows for intelligent matchmaking

Buyer Folio’s objective was to engineer a software system that delivers intelligent matchmaking powered by microservices, integrates seamlessly with external APIs, and adheres to CI/CD principles — enabling fast, accurate, and high-quality real estate connections.

⚙️ System Design & Architecture
Microservice-Based Backend

Architected microservices using Python (FastAPI) and Java (Spring Boot).

Deployed on AWS EC2, exposed through API Gateway, and orchestrated via Docker containers.

Stateless design ensured horizontal scalability and fault isolation.

API Integrations

Developed internal RESTful APIs for user registration, agent search, and feedback ingestion.

Integrated mock third-party APIs (Zillow-style) for external listings, transaction records, and user data enrichment.

Data & Matching Logic

Designed a matching engine as a backend module with modular plug-in architecture.

Used SQL-based heuristics to calculate dynamic match scores based on user location, agent specialization, response time, and client feedback.

Applied XGBoost and Random Forest within the backend service to enhance match accuracy using trained ML models.

Infrastructure & Automation

Infrastructure as code using Terraform for provisioning AWS resources.

CI/CD pipeline setup using GitHub Actions and Jenkins, with automated testing and linting stages.

Secrets and environment management through AWS Parameter Store.

📊 Performance Dashboards & Observability
Developed admin dashboards using Looker and Power BI, integrated via API endpoints for:

Live tracking of agent-client engagement

Real-time match success rate visualization

Aggregated analytics on location heatmaps and feedback scores

Integrated logging with AWS CloudWatch and monitoring using Prometheus + Grafana (planned)

🧪 Issues Tackled
Service Bottlenecks: Initial monolith endpoints were re-engineered into granular microservices to enhance latency and modularity.

Model Bias: Bias toward high-volume agents in initial scoring corrected by normalizing against quality feedback.

Deployment Rollbacks: Automated versioned deployments and rollback mechanisms added using Docker tags and GitHub Actions.

Data Quality Gaps: Implemented data validation schemas using Pydantic and enforced through backend services.

⚡ Outcomes
Achieved a 40% increase in agent-client engagement rate via intelligent scoring.

Reduced average response time to under 500ms across service endpoints.

Integrated ML-based feedback loop improved match quality by 32% in A/B testing.
