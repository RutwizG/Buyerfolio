# 🏡 Buyer Folio Inc. – Real Estate Agent Matching Platform (Data Engineering Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

In the dynamic world of real estate, matching the right agent to a buyer isn't just a matter of availability — it’s about understanding preferences, specialties, location expertise, and proven success. Buyer Folio Inc. aims to revolutionize this space by creating an intelligent, scalable agent-client matching platform powered by data engineering and machine learning.

This project focuses on the **end-to-end development of a data-driven platform** that automates agent-client pairing based on structured data, advanced analytics, and personalized insights. Our goal was to build a system that not only automates matchmaking but also provides real-time metrics on system performance and client satisfaction through interactive dashboards.

## ❗ Business Problem

Traditional real estate platforms rely heavily on manual agent recommendations or broad filters that often mismatch clients. This results in:
- Wasted time for both buyers and agents.
- Poor client satisfaction and agent conversion rates.
- Lack of transparency in performance and feedback loops.

**Buyer Folio's challenge:** Build a system that intelligently matches clients to agents based on data — using historical performance, geographic expertise, specialty, and feedback — while maintaining scalability, automation, and visibility.

## ⚙️ How We Solved It

We approached this by designing a full-stack data engineering system from ingestion to insight delivery:

### 1. **Data Collection**
Collected agent profiles, client preferences, and transaction history via:
- CSV and JSON flat files
- Simulated API calls to external real estate services
- User review and feedback forms

### 2. **ETL Pipelines**
Built using **Python, Pandas, and NumPy**:
- Extracts raw data from multiple sources
- Transforms the data (cleaning, normalization, feature engineering)
- Loads it into **Amazon S3** and optionally **Azure Blob Storage**

### 3. **Data Modeling**
Structured the processed data into schemas registered with **AWS Glue** and queried through **Athena**. Data was optimized for analytical queries with proper partitioning and metadata management.

### 4. **Machine Learning Layer**
- Used **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** to train models that predict agent-client compatibility.
- Key features: location overlap, specialty match, average response time, ratings, transaction volume.

### 5. **Matching Algorithm**
A weighted score system evaluated:
- Specialties (e.g., luxury homes, commercial, first-time buyers)
- Ratings and reviews
- Location coverage
- Response time and conversion rates

### 6. **KPI Dashboard**
Created with **Looker** and **Power BI**, the dashboard visualizes:
- Match success rates
- Active client sessions
- Agent performance and responsiveness
- Overall satisfaction metrics

## 🧪 Issues Faced

- **Data Quality:** Inconsistent formats and missing values across datasets required robust preprocessing.
- **Model Bias:** Early models favored agents with higher volume rather than quality; retraining with adjusted weights fixed this.
- **Latency in Matching:** Real-time matching required re-architecting our logic into lightweight APIs.
- **Deployment Complexity:** Multi-cloud architecture demanded proper configuration and CI/CD integration.
